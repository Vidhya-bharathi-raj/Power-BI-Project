## [Telcom Company Churn Analysis using Power BI](https://github.com/VidhyabharathirajC/Power-BI-Project)

In this project, I utilized Power BI, a leading data visualization tool, to transform a CSV dataset into a compelling dashboard that provides clear insights. The project involved:

### Data Integration and Visualization:
Commenced with importing a comprehensive CSV dataset. Implemented **card** visuals for displaying key metrics such as customer count, phone service subscriptions, and total revenue.
### Demographic and Geographic Insights:
Utilized **clustered bar charts** for demographic analysis, including customer demographics, preferred payment methods, and internet service types.
Employed **map** visuals to illustrate the geographic distribution of customers. Created **funnel** visuals to depict the customer journey from acquisition to churn. Analyzed contract types with a **donut chart** to highlight prevalent contracts.
### In-Depth Churn Analysis:
Developed a **tree map** visual to provide a clear view of the primary reasons for customer churn, offering insights into customer needs and service gaps.
